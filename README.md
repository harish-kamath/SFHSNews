This project was used in the Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) State and National Leadership Conferences during the 2014-2015 season. The project won first place at state (only individual project competing against about teams of 2 or more), and the comments given by the judges indicate a strong indication that the project would perform very well at Nationals. However, because of a file corruption, the national scoring sheets do not reflect this for the submission, but the project file was corrected by the presentation.

## Contents

The project contains a README.pdf file that explains all of the code files. Unfortunately, the original PHP code that controlled the backend of the application was lost when the server was disbanded. However, PHP code from a project conducted the year after is included, and some of the code is the same. NOTE: This is certainly not the same code, and would not work if put on the server. In order to get a better sense of the back-end implementation of this project, read through the User Guide, which includes screenshots of the forms that were backed by PHP to draw the information into the SQL database.
